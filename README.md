## Hello world.. ðŸ‘‹

I like to create things that are useful for people (doesn't always end that way). 

- Codes often, mostly unfinished side projects.
- Android apps and Games / day job / side projects [Playstore Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8865520898596976006)
- Front end tools / utility stuffs

I work at an Indian App Development Company as an Android Developer (as of 2020).

glad if you could lend me some help with some of my projects.
